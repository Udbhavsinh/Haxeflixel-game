Idea of the game: -
I have created a game ( Gilli danda ) which is basically a 2d single player game. In the game we have one paddle at the bottom which we can control and can move it left to right. On the top we have several tiles which we have to break with the ball . when ball will hit the paddle it will strike up and by which we can break the tiles. Whenever we will not be able to save the ball from falling down , a message will be prompted on screen “you lose” and the player will lose a point. After that the game will be restarted. Also between the tile we have placed bullets which player can use to break the tiles, a special ball which will give special advantage to the player and some health kits which will increase the player healthbar. Lastly, if the player will break all the tiles, a message will be prompted “you won” and after which player can either leave the game or can restart it.
In the coding part we have created different files like playstate, menu and assets paths. In playstate we have done the coding of the balls,background,sound and bombs. Also we have set the speeds and rules there.
Also we have creates a folder “assets” in which we have saved images and sound of the game. In the menu state we have set he game name and given the buttons to start or leave game.
